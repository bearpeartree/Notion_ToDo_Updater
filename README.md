# Notion_ToDo_Updater
## About
- Notion is an application that lets you create pages. Nested pages are allowed.
- However since I use Notion for todos it became somehow burdensome.

## The problem 
- Notion is primarily known for digital note taking.
- While it provides a native form of todo (checkbox), it does not organize your todos. Structuring and
organizing todos is the user's concern.
- This means: Before each new semester I had to manually type in week blocks containing empty toggles. Each toggle represents a day of a week. You can add your todos in that toggle. Below there is an example demonstrating it:

## What the program offers
- Mind you the application is only in german.
- So far: adding a new week with empty day-toggles.
